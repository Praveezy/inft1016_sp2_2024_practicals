            <h2>About My First Year</h2>
            <p>My first year in my University was
                completely a new experience. Initialy it was hard being seperated from my parents 
                and adopting to a new environment, later I got used to my new lifestyle with the help of the 
                new friends that I met. My friends have been my biggest strength during my first year.
                Another speciality of my first year in my University is 
                that I leant to manage my responsibilities well and react to my problems in a mature way. I 
                can confidently say my first year has contributed to my character development
